Why would I care about this thing? When to use, for whom is designed, when not to use.

Useful when you want to start up your image from the command line, using parameters, this provides a framework to use: mandatory and optional arguments, logging and error handling.

If an error stops the application, it dumps a fuel file with `thisContext` allowing you to debug the error later. More details about this in the [documentation](docs/Debugging.md)
